TODOS:

- Figure out how to handle orphan points (or whether we need Points at all)

Features:

- Implement time for clover
- Implement more wave types
- ??Implement meta-grids -> for sampling flocking behavior, etc, and apply back to static grid.
- Implement naive-graphs -> dirjkstra, pathfinding
- Circular Grids
- Intersection filters w/processing shapes and 3d shapes.
- **Game of Life.
- Attractor system.
- Gravity / Flock system.
- Add in 3D support.
- Add in gravity / perlin oscilation.

Wishlist:

- Add independent scaling for apply_image

Noise:

- worth looking at thebookofshaders.com
