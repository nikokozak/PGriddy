TODOS:

- Start w/ Noise and Gradient refacs (make separate classes)
- Refac (i.e. last chapter)
- Unit Tests (URGENT)
- Figure out how to handle orphan points (or whether we need Points at all)

Features:

- OBJ export.
- Implement time for clover
- Implement more wave types
- ??Implement meta-grids -> for sampling flocking behavior, etc, and apply back to static grid.
- Implement naive-graphs -> dirjkstra, pathfinding
- Circular Grids
- Intersection filters w/processing shapes and 3d shapes.
- **Game of Life.
- Attractor system.
- Gravity / Flock system.
- Add in gravity / perlin oscilation.

Wishlist:

- Add independent scaling for apply_image

Noise:
- https://github.com/damdoy/noise_functions/blob/master/noise_functions.js
- worth looking at thebookofshaders.com
