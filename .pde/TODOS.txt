TODOS:

- Add opacity to weight adders.
- Implement Selections for applicators
- Figure out how to handle orphan points (or whether we need Points at all)

Features:

- Implement more noise / wave types
- Implement meta-grids -> for sampling flocking behavior, etc, and apply back to static grid.
- Implement naive-graphs -> dirjkstra, pathfinding
- Circular Grids
- Intersection filters w/processing shapes and 3d shapes.
- Game of Life.
- Add in text support.
- Attractor system.
- Gravity / Flock system.
- Add in 3D support.
- Add in gravity / perlin oscilation.

Wishlist:

- Add independent scaling for apply_image

Noise:
- https://github.com/damdoy/noise_functions/blob/master/noise_functions.js
- worth looking at thebookofshaders.com
